Hi, Iâ€™m {{ site.author.name }} ðŸ‘‹. This is my blog.
Iâ€™m French and I work as a software engineer, in Montpellier, France.
I'm primarily an iOS engineer, though I have other programming interests.

When Iâ€™m not doing computer stuff, you can find me trail running, reading math stuff or enjoying a glass of wine.
