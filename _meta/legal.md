This blog is published using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), a static site generator. The theme is based on the open-source theme [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/) by Michael Rose. The site is hosted by [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/). [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) is used for code syntax highlighting. [Typora](https://typora.io/) is my markdown editor of choice, used for authoring each article. I also use [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) as text editor. GitHub is used for source control, and each article and the entire source code of this site will be available soon, for collaboration and learning purposes.
